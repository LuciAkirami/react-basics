       * w-full makes the element flexible and responsive to its parentâ€™s width, while max-w-screen-2xl provides a cap on how wide the element can be, ensuring it doesn't become too large on larger screens.

        md
            - md: targets screens that are md (medium) or larger, which typically means screen widths of 768px and above.

        max-md:hidden
